# Hi, I'm Clinton Iwuji
Cybersecurity practitioner | SOC Analyst | Threat Hunter | Network & detection enthusiast

I'm building practical, hands-on defensive skills through labs, simulations, and real-world toolchains. My focus is on detection engineering, network forensics, and cloud security. I document my learning, share detection logic and lab writeups, and build reproducible SOC scenarios.

## 🔭Current Focus
- Threat detection & incident triage in simulated SOC environments  
- Network forensics and packet analysis to validate detections  
- Cloud security posture and detection in AWS & Azure  
- Building reproducible SOC simulation scenarios and automated playbooks

## Tools & Technology
- Network & packet analysis: Wireshark · Zeek · tcpdump · Nmap · Snort · Nessus  
- SIEM / SOAR / logging / detection: Splunk · Wazuh · ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)  
- Endpoint & vulnerability: Wazuh · OpenVAS  
- Cloud: AWS · Azure  
- Scripting & automation: Python · Bash · Git
- Certifications: CompTIA CySA+ · CompTIA Security+

## Featured repositories
- [Hello-I-m-Clinton-Iwuji](https://github.com/Clintoniwuji29/Hello-I-m-Clinton-Iwuji) — Project about my cybersecurity journey; portfolio & lab notes.  
- [SOC-SIMULATION](https://github.com/Clintoniwuji29/SOC-SIMULATION) — SOC alerts & simulation scenarios (example: blocked outbound URL from blacklist/TI feeds).  
- [Wireshark-Lab](https://github.com/Clintoniwuji29/Wireshark-Lab) — Packet capture labs and analysis exercises.

## Example contributions you’ll find here
- Detection queries and saved searches for Splunk / ELK / Wazuh  
- Playbooks for triage and response (L1 → L2 workflows)  
- PCAP analyses with step-by-step breakdowns and Snort/Zeek signatures  
- Vulnerability scanning notes and OpenVAS/Nessus reports with remediation guidance

## Roadmap / What I’m learning next
- End-to-end detection pipelines (ingest → normalize → detect → enrich → respond)  
- Cloud-native detection engineering for AWS & Azure logs/events  
- Automation of triage for common alert classes using Python playbooks
